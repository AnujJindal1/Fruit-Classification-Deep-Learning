# Fruit Classification using Deep Learning

This is a university-level Deep Learning project developed as part of the  
**BCA (Artificial Intelligence & Data Science)** program.

## Project Overview
- Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer learning with ResNet34 architecture
- Cleaned image dataset with 20 fruit classes
- Probability-based predictions
- Live demo using Gradio

## Dataset and Model
This project uses an image-based dataset and a trained deep learning model.
Due to GitHub file size limitations, large files are hosted on Google Drive.
